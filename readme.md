C program that reads a list of integers from a file, calculates the sum and average of the integers, and writes the result to another file:
This program does the following:

    Declares variables for the sum, count, and average of the integers.
    Opens an input file called input.txt for reading.
    Reads integers from the input file using fscanf(), and calculates the sum using a loop.
    Calculates the average of the integers by dividing the sum by the count.
    Closes the input file.
    Opens an output file called output.txt for writing.
    Writes the sum and average to the output file using fprintf().
    Closes the output file.
